            Hello my name is Alex Canales. I am a passionate sophomore Computer
            Science major at Texas Christian University, with a minor in
            Mathematics and Philosophy. However, even though I go to school in
            Texas, I am originally from Brownsburg, IN. I fell in love with
            Computer Science taking classes like Computer Science Principles,
            Computer Science Applications, Digital Electronics, and
            Cybersecurity. Some other classes that I took in High School that I
            took that gave me a well-rounded preparation for college was
            Calculus BC and Physics Mechanics: C. It was not until the end of my
            senior year of High School that I decided to take the opportunity
            given to me at Texas Christian University to pursue higher
            education.

          I graduated in 2022 at the top of my class, and wanted to pursue
          Computer Science in College from the classes I took from High School.
          I was a part of National Honors Society with a cumulative GPA of 4.6
          on a 4.0 scale. High School activities I was a part of was a tutoring
          program that my school ran. Some hobbies that I picked up in High
          School included skiing, fishing, and playing the guitar. I loved doing
          these things and tried to stick with them as much as I could growing
          up, and continue them in college. I was involved with the wrestling
          team at my High School as well. My Junior year, we finished 12th in
          the nation and I was proud to be a wrestler on that team.

          At Texas Christian University, I have completed two semesters. Within
          these two semesters, I was able to make it on the Dean&#39;s Honors
          List for the TCU College of Science and Engineering for both semesters
          of my Freshman Year. Along with this, I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA
          my second semester of my Freshman Year.
